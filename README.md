# Convex-Optimization
This course contains theory associated with setting up and solving optimization problems. It utilizes the python optimization library scipy.optimize to solve problems of various types.


This repository discusses different methods for the optimization of systems of engineering and economic interest using the techniques of linear and nonlinear programming. The focus is on convex optimization, which is the solution of problems with only one best cost, design, size etc. Optimization has been found to have relevance in solving problems such as least squares, supply chain management, portfolio optimization and other examples across all engineering disciplines. This is to learn about optimization theory, problem formulation and computational setup. The purpose is to understand how to create optimization problems from a physical situation, identify whether the problem can be solved or not, transform problems into equivalent forms, list optimality conditions for problems, find the dual of a problem and identify its relation to the primal, and identify methods to solve convex programming problems using a computer.
